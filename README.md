# View transition demo

See demo on [view-transitions-demo-nextjs.vercel.app](https://view-transitions-demo-nextjs.vercel.app)

This proof of concept made with Next.js 15 demonstrates the use of the [View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) along with the experimental [View Transition Component](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition) in React 19.

Please note that it is not currently supported in Firefox. [Check browser compatibility](https://caniuse.com/view-transitions) for more details.

Additionally, it utilizes [GSAP library](https://gsap.com) to animate elements on the page.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
